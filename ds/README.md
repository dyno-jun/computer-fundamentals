# Arrays and Strings

## Overview

Arrays and Strings are fundamental data structures in computer science. They are used to store collections of data in a
sequential format. Strings are typically arrays of characters.

## Key Concepts

- **Array**: A fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
- **String**: A sequence of characters used to represent text, typically implemented as an array.

## Common Operations

### Arrays

- Access by index
- Traversal
- Insertion and deletion
- Sorting
- Searching

### Strings

- Concatenation
- Substring extraction
- Character replacement
- Reversal
- Case transformation

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Array (O) | String (O) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Access    | O(1)      | O(1)       |
| Search    | O(n)      | O(n)       |
| Insertion | O(n)      | O(n)       |
| Deletion  | O(n)      | O(n)       |

## Use Cases

- **Arrays**: Used in dynamic programming, matrix manipulations, and implementing other data structures.
- **Strings**: Commonly used for text processing, searching patterns, and cryptography.

## Examples

1. Reverse a string.
2. Find the maximum element in an array.
3. Check if two strings are anagrams.
